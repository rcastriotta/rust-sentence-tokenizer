[His name was K'ung Ch'iu, and his style (corresponding to\nour Christian name) was Chung-ni.]
[His countrymen speak of him as K'ung\nFu-tzu, the Master, or philosopher K'ung.]
[This expression was altered\ninto Confucius by the Jesuit missionaries who first carried his fame\nto Europe.]
[[Footnote 1: According to the great historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien.]
[Other\nauthorities say, 552 and 551 B.C.]\n\nSince the golden days of the Emperors Yao and Shun, the legendary\nfounders of the Chinese Empire, nearly two thousand years had passed.]
[Shun chose as his successor Yue, who had been his chief minister, a man\nwhose devotion to duty was such that when engaged in draining the\nempire of the great flood--a task that took eight years to\naccomplish--he never entered his home till the work was done, although\nin the course of his labours he had thrice to pass his door.]
[He\nfounded the Hsia dynasty, which lasted till 1766 B.C. The last emperor\nof this line, a vile tyrant, was overthrown by T'ang, who became the\nfirst ruler of the house of Shang, or Yin.]
[This dynasty again\ndegenerated in course of time and came to an end in Chou, or Chou Hsin\n(1154-22 B.C.), a monster of lust, extravagance, and cruelty.]
[The\nempire was only held together by the strength and wisdom of the Duke\nof Chou, or King Wen, to give him his popular title, one of the\ngreatest men in Chinese history.]
[He controlled two-thirds of the\nempire; but, believing that the people were not yet ready for a\nchange, he refrained from dethroning the emperor.]
[In his day 'the\nhusbandman paid one in nine; the pay of the officers was hereditary;\nmen were questioned at barriers and at markets, but there were no\ntolls; fishgarths were not preserved; the children of criminals were\nsackless.]
[The old and wifeless--the widower; the old and\nhusbandless--the widow; the old and childless--the lone one; the young\nand fatherless--the orphan; these four are the people most in need\nbelow heaven, and they have no one to whom to cry, so when King Wen\nreigned his love went out first to them' (Mencius, Book II, chapter\n5).]
[After his death, his son, King Wu, decided that the nation was\nripe for change.]
[He overcame Chou Hsin by force of arms, and, placing\nhimself on the throne, became the founder of the Chou dynasty.]
[In the time of Confucius the Chou dynasty still filled the throne.]
[But\nit had long since become effete, and all power had passed into the\nhands of the great vassals.]
[The condition of China was much like that\nof Germany in the worst days of the Holy Roman Empire.]
[The emperor was\npowerless, the various vassal states were independent in all but name,\nand often at war one with the other.]
[These states again were\ndisintegrated, and their rulers impotent against encroaching\nfeudatories.]
[In Confucius' native state, Lu, the duke was a mere\nshadow.]
[The younger branches of his house had usurped all power.]
[Three\nin number, they were called the Three Clans.]
[The most important of the\nthree was the Chi, or Chi-sun clan, whose chiefs Chi Huan and Chi\nK'ang are often mentioned by Confucius.]
[But the power of the Chi, too,\nwas ill-secured.]
[The minister Yang Huo overawed his master, and once\neven threw him into prison.]
[Nor was the condition of the other states\nof the empire better than that of Lu.]
[Confucius thought it worse.]
[Into this turbulent world Confucius was born.]
[Though his father was\nonly a poor military officer, he could trace his descent from the\nimperial house of Yin.]
[Confucius married at nineteen, and is known to\nhave had one son and one daughter.]
[Shortly after his marriage he\nentered the service of the state as keeper of the granary.]
[A year\nlater he was put in charge of the public fields.]
[In 527 B.C. his\nmother died, and, in obedience to Chinese custom, he had to retire\nfrom public life.]
[When the years of mourning were over, he did not\nagain take office, but devoted himself instead to study and teaching.]
[As the years rolled by his fame grew, and a band of pupils gathered\nround him.]
[In 517 B.C. the anarchy in Lu reached such a pitch that\nConfucius moved to the neighbouring land of Ch'i.]
[Here he had several\ninterviews with the reigning duke, but met with little encouragement\n(xviii.]
[3).]
[So he soon returned to his native country, and resumed for\nfifteen years his work as student and teacher.]
[During these fifteen years the power of the duke sank lower and lower,\nand the Chi was menaced by his minister Yang Huo.]
[In times so dark,\nmen that loved quiet sought in the world of thought an escape from the\ngloom around them, whilst others that were less resigned turned over\nin their minds the causes of the realm's decay.]
[Lao-tzu, the founder\nof the mystic Taoist philosophy, taught that in inaction alone peace\ncan be found; Mo-tzu proclaimed the doctrine of universal love: that\nwe should love all men as we love self, love the parents of others as\nwe love our own parents.]
[Upright men were driven or fled from the\nworld.]
[Confucius often met them in his wanderings, and was reproved\nfor not doing as they did.]
[But his practical mind told him that\ninaction could not help the world, and that to find a remedy for the\nnation's ills, their cause must first be learned.]
[This could only be\ndone by historical study.]
[He therefore devoted himself to the study of\npast times, edited in later life the _Book of History_, and compiled\nthe work called _Spring and Autumn_, a history of his native state\nfrom 722 to 481 B.C. To bring again the golden days of Yao and Shun a\nreturn must be made to the principles of Wen and Wu, the kings that\nhad rebuilt the empire after tyranny and selfishness had laid it low.]
[Of impracticable ideals and renunciation of the world no good could\ncome.]
[At last in 501 B.C. Yang Huo was forced to flee from Lu, and prospects\nbrightened.]
[A year later Confucius was appointed governor of a town.]
[So great was his success as governor that before long he was promoted\nto be Superintendent of Works, and then to be Chief Criminal Judge.]
[He\nwon great influence with his master, and did much to lighten the\ngeneral misery.]
[He so strengthened the power of the duke that\nneighbouring states grew jealous.]
[To sow dissension between duke and\nminister the men of Ch'i sent the duke a gift of singing girls.]
[Such\njoy they gave him that for three days no court was held.]
[On this\nConfucius left the land, 497 B.C.\n\nFor the next thirteen years Confucius wandered from land to land,\nfollowed by his disciples, seeking in vain for a ruler that was\nwilling to employ him, and whom he was willing to serve.]
[At times he\nwas exposed to danger, at other times to want.]
[But as a rule he was\ntreated with consideration, although his teachings were ignored.]
[Yet\nthirteen years of homeless wandering, of hopes deferred and\nfrustrated, must have been hard to bear.]
[When he left office Confucius\nwas already fifty-three years old, and his life so far seemed a\nfailure.]
[The sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now\nand again to take office under an unworthy ruler; but knowing that no\ngood could come of it he refrained, and probably he never seriously\nthought of doing so.]
[In 483 B.C., when Confucius was sixty-six years old, through the\ninfluence of his disciple Jan Yu, who was in the service of the Chi,\nthe Master was invited to return to his native land.]
[Here he remained\ntill his death in 479 B.C.]
[He had many interviews with the reigning\nduke and the head of the Chi clan, but gained no influence over either\nof them.]
[So he turned once more to his favourite studies; edited the\n_Book of Poetry_--perhaps the most interesting collection of ancient\nsongs extant--and wrote _Spring and Autumn_.]
[His closing years were\ndarkened by the loss of those dearest to him.]
[First his son died, then\nYen Yuean, the disciple whom he loved best.]
[At his death the Master was\novercome by grief, and he left none behind him that loved learning.]
[Lastly Tzu-lu, the frank and bold, was killed in battle.]
[A little\nlater, in his seventy-first year, Confucius himself passed away, 479\nB.C.\n\nThis book of the Master's Sayings is believed by the Chinese to have\nbeen written by the disciples of Confucius.]
[But there is nothing to\nprove this, and some passages in the book point the other way.]
[Book\nviii speaks of the death of Tseng-tzu, who did not die till 437 B.C.,\nforty-two years after the Master.]
[The chief authority for the text as\nit stands to-day is a manuscript found in the house of Confucius in\n150 B.C., hidden there, in all likelihood, between the years 213 and\n211 B.C., when the reigning emperor was seeking to destroy every copy\nof the classics.]
[We find no earlier reference to the book under its\npresent name.]
[But Mencius (372-289 B.C.) quotes seven passages from\nit, in language all but identical with the present text, as the words\nof Confucius.]
[No man ever talked the language of these sayings.]
[Such\npith and smoothness is only reached by a long process of rounding and\npolishing.]
[We shall probably come no nearer to the truth than Legge's\nconclusion that the book was put together by the pupils of the\ndisciples of Confucius, from the words and notebooks of their masters,\nabout the year 400 B.C.\n\nLEONARD A. LYALL.]
[AMALFI,\n\n_January, 1909_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\nSuch information as seemed necessary to enable the reader to\nunderstand the text, or that appeared to me to be of general interest,\nI have given in the notes at the foot of the page.]
[Further details\nabout the men and places mentioned in the text will be found in the\nIndex.]
[Dates I have taken from Legge, Hirth and other standard authors.]
[In Chinese names, consonants are generally pronounced as in English,\nvowels as in Italian.]
[_E_, when not joined with _i_, is pronounced nearly as German _oe_, or\nmuch as _u_ in English l_u_ck.]
[_ao_ rhymes approximately with h_ow_\n_ei_   \"          \"        \"   th_ey_\n_ou_   \"          \"        \"   th_ough_\n_uo_   \"          \"        \"   p_oo_r,\n\nthe _u_ being equivalent to _w_.]
[_Chih_ and _Shih_ rhyme approximately with _her_.]

[*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS\n\nBOOK I\n\n\n1. The Master said, To learn and then do, is not that a pleasure?]
[When\nfriends come from afar do we not rejoice?]
[To live unknown and not\nfret, is not that to be a gentleman?]
[2.]
[Yu-tzu[2] said.]
[Few men that are good sons and good brothers are\nfond of withstanding those over them.]
[A man that is not fond of\nwithstanding those over him and is yet fond of broils is nowhere\nfound.]
[A gentleman heeds the roots.]
[When the root has taken, the Way\nis born.]
[And to be a good son and a good brother, is not that the root\nof love?]
[[Footnote 2: A disciple.]
[]\n\n3. The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found\nwith love.]
[4. Tseng-tzu[3] said, Thrice daily I ask myself: In dealing for\nothers, have I been unfaithful?]
[Have I been untrue to friends?]
[Do I\npractise what I preach?]
[[Footnote 3: A disciple.]
[]\n\n5. The Master said, To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour\nbusiness and be true; spend little and love men; time thy calls on the\npeople.]
[6. The Master said, The young should be dutiful at home, modest\nabroad, careful and true, overflowing in kindness for all, but in\nbrotherhood with love.]
[And if they have strength to spare they should\nspend it on the arts.]
[7. Tzu-hsia[3] said, If a man eschews beauty and honours worth, if he\nserves his father and mother with all his strength, if he is ready to\ngive his life for his lord, and keeps faith with his friends, though\nothers may say he has no learning, I must call him learned.]
[8. The Master said, A gentleman will not be looked up to unless he is\nstaid, nor will his learning be sound.]

[[Footnote 4: A disciple.]
[]\n\n10.]
[Tzu-ch'in[5] said to Tzu-kung,[6] When he comes to a country the\nMaster always hears how it is governed; does he ask, or is it told\nhim?]
[[Footnote 5: A disciple.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 6: A disciple.]
[]\n\nTzu-kung said, The Master gets it by his warmth and honesty, by\npoliteness, modesty and yielding.]
[The way the Master asks is unlike\nother men's asking.]
[11. The Master said, Whilst thy father lives look for his purpose;\nwhen he is gone, look how he walked.]
[To change nothing in thy father's\nways for three years may be called pious.]
[12, Yu-tzu[7] said, To behave with ease is the best part of courtesy.]
[This was the beauty of the old kings' ways; this they followed in\nsmall and great.]
[But knowing this, it will not do to give way to ease,\nunchecked by courtesy.]
[This too is wrong.]
[[Footnote 7: A disciple.]
[]\n\n13.]
[Yu-tzu said, If pledges are close to right, word can be kept.]
[If\nattentions are close to courtesy, shame will be kept far.]
[If we do not\nchoose our leaders wrong, we may worship them too.]
[14. The Master said, A gentleman that does not seek to eat his fill,\nnor look for ease in his home, who is earnest at work and careful of\nspeech, who walks with those that keep the Way, and is guided by them,\nmay be said to love learning.]
[15. Tzu-kung[8] said, Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud: how\nwould that be?]
[[Footnote 8: A disciple.]
[]\n\nIt would do, said the Master; but better still were poor but merry;\nrich, but loving courtesy.]
[Tzu-kung said, When the poem says:\n\n    If ye cut, if ye file,\n      If ye polish and grind,\n\nis that what is meant?]
[The Master said, Now I can begin to talk of poetry to Tz'u.]
[Tell him\nwhat is gone, and he knows what shall come.]
[16. The Master said, Not to be known is no sorrow.]
[My sorrow is not\nknowing men.]
[BOOK II\n\n\n1. The Master said, He that rules by mind is like the north star,\nsteady in his seat, whilst the stars all bend to him.]
[2. The Master said, The three hundred poems are summed up in the one\nline, Think no evil.]
[3. The Master said, Guide the people by law, aline them by punishment;\nthey may shun crime, but they will want shame.]
[Guide them by mind,\naline them by courtesy; they will learn shame and grow good.]
[4. The Master said, At fifteen, I had the will to learn; at thirty, I\ncould stand; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I understood the\nheavenly Bidding; at sixty, my ears were opened[9]; at seventy, I\ncould do as my heart lusted without trespassing from the square.]
[[Footnote 9: _Lit._, obedient.]
[]\n\n5.]
[Meng Yi asked the duty of a son.]
[The Master said, Not to transgress.]
[As Fan Chi'ih[10] was driving him, the Master said, Meng-sun[11] asked\nme the duty of a son; I answered, Not to transgress.]
[[Footnote 10: A disciple.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 11: Meng Yi.]
[]\n\nWhat did ye mean?]
[said Fan Chi'ih.]
[To serve our father and mother with courtesy whilst they live; to bury\nthem with courtesy when they die, and to worship them with courtesy.]
[6.]
[Meng Wu asked the duty of a son.]
[The Master said, He should not grieve his father and mother by\nanything but illness.]
[7. Tzu-yu[12] asked the duty of a son.]
[[Footnote 12: A disciple.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, He that can feed his parents is now called a good\nson.]
[But both dogs and horses are fed, and unless we honour our\nparents, what is the difference?]
[8. Tzu-hsia[13] asked the duty of a son.]
[[Footnote 13: A disciple.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, Our manner is the hard part.]
[For the young to be a\nstay in toil and leave the wine and food to their elders, is this to\nfulfil their duty?]
[9. The Master said, If I talk all day to Hui,[14] like a dullard, he\nnever differs from me.]
[But when he is gone, if I watch him when alone,\nhe can carry out what I taught.]
[No, Hui is no dullard!]
[[Footnote 14: The disciple Yen Yuean.]
[]\n\n10. The Master said, See what he does; watch what moves him; search\nwhat pleases him: can the man lie hidden?]

[15. The Master said, Learning without thought is naught; thought\nwithout learning is dangerous.]
[16. The Master said, To fight strange doctrines does harm.]
[17. The Master said, Yu,[16] shall I teach thee what is wisdom?]
[To\nknow what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom.]
[[Footnote 16: The disciple Tzu-lu.]
[]\n\n18.]
[Tsu-chang[17] learned with an eye to pay.]
[[Footnote 17: A disciple.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, Hear much, leave all that is doubtful alone, speak\nwarily of everything else, and few will be offended.]
[See much, leave\nall that is dangerous alone, deal warily with everything else, and\nthou wilt have little to rue.]
[If thy words seldom give offence, and\nthy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow.]
[19.]
[Duke Ai[18] asked, What should I do to win the people?]
[[Footnote 18: Of Lu.]
[]\n\nConfucius answered, Lift up the straight, put away the crooked; and\nthe people will be won.]
[Lift up the crooked, put away the straight;\nand the people will not be won.]
[20. Chi K'ang[19] asked how to make the people lowly, faithful and\npainstaking.]
[[Footnote 19: The head of the Chi clan.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, Meet them with dignity, they will be lowly; be a good\nson and merciful, they will be faithful; lift up the good and teach\nthe unskilled, and they will take pains.]
[21.]
[One said to Confucius, Why do ye not govern, Sir?]
[The Master said, What does the Book[20] say of a good son?]
['To be a\ngood son and a friend to thy brothers is to show how to govern.]
['\nThis, too, is to govern.]
[Must one be in office to govern?]
[[Footnote 20: The Book of History.]
[]\n\n22. The Master said, A man without truth, I know not what good he is!]
[A cart without a crosspole, a carriage without a yoke, how can they be\nmoved?]
[23. Tzu-chang[21] asked whether we can know what is to be ten\ngenerations hence.]
[[Footnote 21: A disciple.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, The Yin[22] took over the manners of the Hsia; the\nharm and the good that they did them can be known.]
[The Chou took over\nthe manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they did them can\nbe known.]
[And we may know what shall be, even an hundred generations\nhence, whoever follows Chou.]
[[Footnote 22: Up to the time of Confucius, China had been ruled by\nthree lines of kings.]
[First the T'ang, next the Yin or Shang, then the\nChou.]
[]\n\n24. The Master said, To worship the ghosts of men not akin to us is\nfawning.]
[To see the right and not do it is want of courage.]
[BOOK III\n\n\n1.]
[Of the Chi having eight rows of dancers[23] in his courtyard,\nConfucius said, If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?]
[[Footnote 23: An Imperial prerogative.]
[]\n\n2.]
[When the sacrifice was ended, the Three Clans had the Yung hymn\nsung.]
[The Master said,\n\n    Princes and dukes assist.]
[Solemn is the Son of heaven;\n\nwhat meaning has this in the courtyard of the Three Clans?]
[3. The Master said, A man without love, what is courtesy to him?]
[A man\nwithout love, what is music to him?]
[4.]
[Lin Fang asked what good form is at root.]
[The Master said, A big question!]
[At high-tides, thrift is better than\nwaste; at burials, grief is worth more than nicety.]
[5. The Master said, Every wild tribe has its lord, whereas the lands\nof Hsia[24] have none!]
[[Footnote 24: China.]
[]\n\n6. The Chi sacrificed to Mount T'ai.]
[[25]\n\n[Footnote 25: A prerogative of the Duke of Lu.]
[]\n\nThe Master said to Jan Yu,[26] Canst thou not stop this?]
[[Footnote 26: A disciple in the service of the Chi.]
[]\n\nHe answered, I cannot.]
[Alas!]
[said the Master; dost thou think Mount T'ai less wise than Lin\nFang?]
[7. The Master said, A gentleman never strives with others.]
[Or must he,\nperhaps, in shooting?]
[But then, as he bows and makes way in going up\nor steps down to drink,[27] his strife is that of a gentleman.]
[[Footnote 27: The loser had to drink a cup of wine.]
[]\n\n8. Tzu-hsia asked, What is the meaning of:\n\n    Her cunning smiles,\n    Her dimples light,\n    Her lovely eyes,\n    So clear and bright,\n    All unadorned,\n    The background white.]
[Colouring, said the Master, is second to the plain ground.]
[Then good form is second, said Tzu-hsia.]
[Shang,[28] said the Master, thou hast hit my meaning!]
[Now I can talk\nof poetry to thee.]
[[Footnote 28: Tzu-hsia.]
[]\n\n9. The Master said, I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but as proof\nof them Chi[29] is not enough.]
[I can speak of the manners of Yin; but\nas proof of them Sung is not enough.]
[This is due to their dearth of\nbooks and great men.]
[If there were enough of these, I could use them\nas proofs.]
[[Footnote 29: Chi was the homeland of the House of Hsia, Sung that of\nthe House of Yin.]
[]\n\n10. The Master said, After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice,\nI have no wish to see more.]
[11.]
[One asked the meaning of the Great Sacrifice.]
[The Master said, I do not know.]
[He that knew the meaning would\noverlook all below heaven as I do this--and he pointed to his palm.]
[12.]
[He worshipped as if those whom he worshipped were before him; he\nworshipped the spirits as if they were before him.]
[The Master said: For me, to take no part in the sacrifice is the same\nas not sacrificing.]
[13.]
[Wang-sun Chia[30] said, What is the meaning of, It is better to\ncourt the hearth-god than the god of the home?]
[[Footnote 30: Wang-sun Chia was minister of Wei, and had more\ninfluence than his master.]
[The hearth-god ranks below the god of the\nhome (the Roman _lares_), but since he sees all that goes on in the\nhouse, and ascends to heaven at the end of the year to report what has\nhappened, it is well to be on good terms with him.]
[]\n\nNot so, said the Master.]
[A sin against Heaven leaves no room for\nprayer.]
[14. The Master said, Chou[31] looks back on two lines of kings.]
[How\nrich, how rich it is in art!]
[I follow Chou.]
[[Footnote 31: The royal house of Chou, which was then ruling China.]
[]\n\n15.]
[On going into the Great Temple the Master asked about everything.]
[One said, Who says that the Tsou man's son knows the rites?]

[[32]\n\n[Footnote 32: _Tremble_ and _chestnut_ have the same sound in\nChinese.]
[]\n\nOn hearing this, the Master said, I do not speak of what is ended,\nchide what is settled, or find fault with what is past.]
[[33]\n\n[Footnote 33: In old times men had been sacrificed at the\nearth-altars, and Tsai Wo's answer might seem to approve the\npractice.]
[]\n\n22. The Master said, How shallow was Kuan Chung!]
[But, said one, was not Kuan Chung thrifty?]
[The Kuan, said the Master, owned San Kuei, and no one of his household\nheld two posts: was that thrift?]
[At least Kuan Chung knew good form.]
[The Master said, Kings screen their gates with trees; the Kuan, too,\nhad trees to screen his gate.]
[When two kings are carousing, they have\na stand for the turned-down cups; the Kuan had a turned-down\ncup-stand, too!]
[If the Kuan knew good form, who does not know good\nform?]
[[34]\n\n[Footnote 34: Kuan Chung (+ 645 B.C.), a famous man in his day, was\nchief minister to the Duke of Ch'i, whom he raised to such wealth and\npower that he became the leading prince of the empire.]

[The Way\nhas long been lost below heaven!]
[Now Heaven shall make the Master into\na warning bell.]
[25. The Master said of the music of Shao, It is thoroughly beautiful,\nand thoroughly good, too.]
[Of the music of Wu, he said, It is\nthoroughly beautiful, but not thoroughly good.]
[26. The Master said, Rank without beauty; ceremony without reverence;\nmourning without grief, why should I cast them a glance?]
[BOOK IV\n\n\n1. The Master said, Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to\ndwell in love, has he got wisdom?]
[2. The Master said, Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot\nbear fortune long.]
[Loving men find peace in love, the wise find profit\nin it.]

[4. The Master said, A will set on love is free from evil.]
[5. The Master said, Wealth and honours are what men desire; but do not\ngo from the Way, to keep them.]
[Lowliness and want are hated by men;\nbut do not go from the Way, to escape them.]

[Not for one moment\nmay a gentleman sin against love; he must not do so in flurry and\nhaste, nor do so in utter overthrow.]
[6. The Master said, I have seen no one that loves love and hates\nuncharity.]
[He that loves love will set nothing higher.]
[The hater of\nuncharity is so given to love that no uncharity can enter into his\nlife.]

[Care not for being unknown, but seek to be\nworthy of note.]
[15. The Master said, One line, Shen,[37] runs through my Way.]
[[Footnote 37: The disciple Tseng-tzu.]

[If thou must travel, hold a set course.]
[20. The Master said, He that changes nothing in his father's ways for\nthree years may be called pious.]

[He gave him his daughter to wed.\n\nOf Nan Jung the Master said, When the land keeps the Way he will not\nbe neglected; and if the land loses the Way he will escape punishment\nand death.]
[He gave him his brother's daughter to wed.\n\n2.]

[Thou art a vessel, said the Master.]
[What kind of vessel?]

[[Footnote 38: A disciple born in Lu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 39: The disciple Chung-kung.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, What is the good of being glib?]

[He answered, For this I want confidence.]
[The Master was pleased.]
[6. The Master said, Forsaken is the Way!]

[When Tzu-lu heard this he was glad.]
[The Master said, Yu loves daring more than I do, but he is at a loss\nhow to take things.]
[7.]
[Meng Wu asked whether Tzu-lu had love.]
[I do not know, said the Master.]
[He asked again.]
[A land of a thousand chariots might give Yu charge of its levies; but\nwhether love be his I do not know.]
[And how about Ch'iu?]
[[41]\n\nA town of a thousand households, a clan of an hundred chariots might\nmake Ch'iu governor; but whether love be his I do not know.]
[And how about Ch'ih?]
[[42]\n\nStanding in the court, girt with his sash, Ch'ih might entertain the\nguests; but whether love be his I do not know.]
[8. The Master said to Tzu-kung, Which is the better man, thou or\nHui[43]?]

[]\n\nThe Master said, Rotten wood cannot be carved, nor are dung walls\nplastered.]
[Why chide with Yue?]

[When I meet them now, I listen to their\nwords and watch their deeds.]

[10. The Master said, I have met no firm man.]
[One answered, Shen Ch'ang.]
[The Master said, Ch'ang is passionate; how can he be firm?]
[11. Tzu-kung said, What I do not wish done to me, I likewise wish not\nto do to others.]
[The Master said, That is still beyond thee, Tz'u.]
[12. Tzu-kung said, To hear the Master on his art and precepts is\ngranted us; but to hear him on man's nature and the Way of Heaven is\nnot.]
[13.]
[Until Tzu-lu could do what he had heard, his only fear was to hear\nmore.]
[14. Tzu-kung asked, Why was K'ung-wen called cultured?]
[The Master said, He was quick and loved learning; he was not ashamed\nto ask those beneath him: that is why he was called cultured.]
[15. The Master said, Of the ways of a gentleman Tzu-ch'an had four.]
[His life was modest; he honoured those that he served.]

[16. The Master said, Yen P'ing was a good friend.]
[The longer he knew\nyou, the more attentive he grew.]

[18. Tzu-chang said, The chief minister, Tzu-wen, was thrice made\nminister without showing gladness, thrice he left office with unmoved\nlooks.]
[He always told the new ministers how the old ones had governed:\nhow was that?]
[He was faithful, said the Master.]
[But was it love?]
[I do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?]
[When Ts'ui murdered the lord of Ch'i, Ch'en Wen threw up ten teams of\nhorses and left the land.]
[On coming to another kingdom he said, 'Like\nmy lord Ts'ui,' and left it.]
[On coming to a second kingdom he said\nagain, 'Like my lord Ts'ui,' and left it: how was that?]
[He was clean, said the Master.]

[19. Chi Wen thought thrice before acting.]
[On hearing this the Master said, Twice is enough.]
[20. The Master said, Whilst the land kept the Way Ning Wu showed\nwisdom; when his land lost the Way he grew simple.]

[When he was in Ch'en the Master said, Home, I must go home!]
[Zealous, or rash, or finished scholars, my young sons at home do not\nknow what pruning they still need!]
[22. The Master said, Because Po-yi and Shu-ch'i never remembered old\nwickedness they made few enemies.]
[[46]\n\n23. The Master said, Who can call Wei-sheng Kao straight?]
[A man begged\nhim for vinegar: he begged it of a neighbour, and gave it.]
[24. The Master said, Smooth words, fawning looks, and overdone\nhumility, Tso Ch'iu-ming thought shameful, and so do I.]
[He thought it\nshameful to hide ill-will and ape friendship, and so do I.]
[25.]
[As Yen Yuean and Chi-lu[47] were sitting with him, the Master said,\nWhy not each of you tell me thy wishes?]
[[Footnote 46: Po-yi and Shu-ch'i were sons of the King of Ku-chu.]
[Their father left the throne to the younger of the two; but he would\nnot supplant the elder, nor would the elder go against his father's\nwishes.]
[So they both retired into obscurity.]
[When King Wu overthrew\nthe tyrant Chou (1122 B.C.), they starved to death, rather than live\nunder a new dynasty.]
[Of Po-yi Mencius tells us (Book X, chapter 1):\n'His eyes would not look on an evil face, his ears would not listen to\nan evil sound.]
[He served none but his own lord, he ruled none but his\nown people.]
[He came in when there was order, and withdrew when tumults\ncame.]
[Where lawless rule showed, or lawless people stayed, he could\nnot bear to dwell.]
[To be together with country folk he thought like\nsitting in court dress and court cap on dust and ashes.]
[In Chou's time\nhe dwelt by the North Sea shore, waiting for all below heaven to grow\nclean.]
[So, hearing the ways of Po-yi, the fool grows honest, and the\nweakling's purpose stands.]
[']\n\n[Footnote 47: Tzu-lu.]
[]\n\nTzu-lu said, I should like carriages and horses, and clothes of light\nfur to share with my friends, and, if they spoiled them, not to get\nangry.]
[Yen Yuean said, I should like to make no boast of talent or show or\nmerit.]
[Tzu-lu said, We should like to hear your wishes, Sir.]
[The Master said, To give the old folk peace, to be true to friends,\nand to have a heart for the young.]
[26. The Master said, It is finished!]
[I have met no one that can see\nhis own faults and arraign himself within.]

[BOOK VI\n\n\n1. The Master said, Yung[48] might fill the seat of a prince.]
[And might Tzu-sang Po-tzu?]
[asked Chung-kung.]
[Yes, said the Master; but he is slack.]
[To be stern to himself, said Chung-kung, and slack in his claims on\nthe people, might do; but to be slack himself and slack with others\nmust surely be too slack.]
[The Master said, What Yung says is true.]
[2.]
[Duke Ai asked which disciples loved learning.]
[Confucius answered, Yen Hui[49] loved learning.]

[]\n\nWhen Yuean Ssu was made governor he was given nine hundred measures of\ngrain, which he refused.]
[Not so, said the Master: why not take it and give it to thy neighbours\nand countryfolk?]
[4. The Master said of Chung-kung, If the calf of a brindled cow be red\nand horned, though men be shy to offer him, will the hills and streams\nreject him?]
[5. The Master said, For three months together Hui's[52] heart never\nsinned against love.]
[The others may hold out for a day, or a month,\nbut no more.]
[6. Chi K'ang[53] asked whether Chung-yu[3] was fit to govern.]
[The Master said, Yu[54] is firm; what would governing be to him?]
[And is Tz'u[55] fit to govern?]
[Tz'u is thorough; what would governing be to him?]
[And is Ch'iu[56] fit to govern?]
[Ch'in is clever; what would governing be to him?]
[7. The Chi sent to make Min Tzu-ch'ien[6] governor of Pi.]

[Grasping his\nhand through the window, he said, He is going.]

[]\n\n9. The Master said.]
[What a man was Hui!]
[[58] A bowl of rice, a gourd of\nwater, in a low alley; man cannot bear such misery!]
[Yet Hui never fell\nfrom mirth.]
[What a man he was!]
[10.]
[Jan Ch'iu[59] said, It is not that I take no pleasure in the\nMaster's Way: I want strength.]
[[Footnote 58: Yen Yuean.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 59: Jan Yu.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, He that wants strength faints midway; but thou\ndrawest a line.]
[11. The Master said to Tzu-hsia, Study to be a gentleman, not as the\nsmall man studies.]
[12.]
[When Tzu-yu was governor of Wu-ch'eng, the Master said, Hast thou\ngotten any men?]

[The Master said, To foster right among the people; to honour ghosts\nand spirits, and yet keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.]
[He asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, To rank the effort above the prize may be called\nlove.]
[21. The Master said, Wisdom delights in water; love delights in hills.]
[Wisdom is stirring; love is quiet.]

[The Master said, What has this to do with love?]
[Must it not be\nholiness?]
[Yao and Shun[63] still yearned for this.]
[Seeking a foothold\nfor self, love finds a foothold for others; seeking light for itself,\nit enlightens others too.]
[To learn from the near at hand may be called\nthe clue to love.]
[[Footnote 62: The dissolute wife of Duke Ling of Wei.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 63: Two emperors of the golden age.]

[[64]\n\n2. The Master said, To think things over in silence, to learn and be\nalways hungry, to teach and never weary; is any of these mine?]
[3. The Master said, Not making the most of my mind, want of\nthoroughness in learning, failure to do the right when told it, lack\nof strength to overcome faults; these are my sorrows.]

[He was the younger brother of King Wu,\nthe founder of the Chou dynasty, as great in peace as the King in war.]
[He was so bent on carrying out the old principles of government that\n'if anything did not tally with them, he looked up and thought, till\nday passed into night, and if by luck he found the answer he sat and\nwaited for the dawn' (Mencius, Book VIII, chapter 20).]
[]\n\nIf I lift one corner and the other three are left unturned, I say no\nmore.]

[Tzu-lu said, If ye had to lead three armies, Sir, whom would ye have\nwith you?]
[No man, said the Master, that would face a tiger bare-fisted, or\nplunge into a river and die without a qualm; but one, indeed, who,\nfearing what may come, lays his plans well and carries them through.]

[When Duke Ling died, he was succeeded by his grandson, who opposed by\nforce his father's attempts to seize the throne.]
[]\n\nI shall ask him, said Tzu-kung.]
[He went in, and said, What kind of men were Po-yi[67] and Shu-ch'i?]

[Tzu-kung went out, and said, The Master is not for him.]
[15. The Master said, Eating coarse rice and drinking water, with bent\narm for pillow, we may be merry; but ill-gotten wealth and honours are\nto me a wandering cloud.]

[26. The Master angled, but he did not fish with a net; he shot, but\nnot at birds sitting.]
[27. The Master said, There may be men that do things without knowing\nwhy.]

[When a lad was seen by the\nMaster, the disciples doubted.]

[Tzu-lu said, What with the people and the spirits of earth and corn,\nmust a man read books to become learned?]
[The Master said, This is why I hate a glib tongue.]
[25. The Master said to Tzu-lu, Tseng Hsi,[111] Jan Yu and Kung-hsi Hua\nas they sat beside him, I may be a day older than you, but forget\nthat.]
[Ye are wont to say, I am unknown.]
[Well, if ye were known, what\nwould ye do?]
[[Footnote 108: The younger brother of Chi Huan, the head of the Chi\nclan.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 109: Tzu-lu.]
[He and Jan Yu had taken office under the Chi.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 110: Jan Yu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 111: A disciple: the father of Tseng-tzu.]
[]\n\nTzu-lu answered lightly.]
[Give me a land of a thousand chariots,\ncrushed between great neighbours, overrun by soldiers and searched by\nfamine, and within three years I could put courage into it and high\npurpose.]
[The Master smiled.]
[What wouldst thou do, Ch'iu[112]?]
[he said.]
[He answered, Give me a land of sixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty\nsquare miles, and within three years I could give the people plenty.]
[As for courtesy and music, they would wait the coming of a gentleman.]
[And what wouldst thou do, Ch'ih[113]?]
[He answered, I do not speak of what I can do, but of what I should\nlike to learn.]
[At services in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand\nAudience, I should like to fill a small part.]
[And what wouldst thou do, Tien[114]?]
[Tien stopped playing, pushed his still sounding lute aside, rose and\nanswered, My choice would be unlike those of the other three.]
[What harm in that?]
[said the Master.]
[Each but spake his mind.]
[In the last days of spring, all clad for the springtime, with five or\nsix young men and six or seven lads, I would bathe in the Yi, be\nfanned by the wind in the Rain God's glade, and go back home singing.]
[The Master said with a sigh, I side with Tien.]
[Tseng Hsi stayed after the other three had left, and said, What did ye\nthink, Sir, of what the three disciples said?]
[[Footnote 112: Jan Yu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 113: Kung-hsi Hua.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 114: Tseng Hsi.]
[]\n\nEach but spake his mind, said the Master.]
[Why did ye smile at Yu,[115] Sir?]
[Lands are swayed by courtesy, but what he said was not modest.]
[That\nwas why I smiled.]
[Yet did not Ch'iu speak of a state?]
[Where would\nsixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty, square miles be found that are\nnot a state?]
[And did not Ch'ih too speak of a state?]
[Who but great\nvassals are there in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand Audience?]
[But if Ch'ih were to take a small part, who could fill a big one?]
[[Footnote 115: Tzu-lu.]
[]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XII\n\n\n1.]
[Yen Yuean asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, Love is to conquer self and turn to courtesy.]
[If we\ncould conquer self and turn to courtesy for one day, all below heaven\nwould turn to love.]
[Does love flow from within, or does it flow from\nothers?]
[Yen Yuean said, May I ask what are its signs?]
[The Master said, To be always courteous of eye and courteous of ear;\nto be always courteous in word and courteous in deed.]
[Yen Yuean said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these words.]
[2.]
[Chung-kung asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, Without the door to behave as though a great guest\nwere come; to treat the people as though we tendered the great\nsacrifice; not to do unto others what we would not they should do unto\nus; to breed no wrongs in the state and breed no wrongs in the home.]
[Chung-kung said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these\nwords.]
[3. Ssu-ma Niu[116] asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, Love is slow to speak.]
[To be slow to speak!]
[Can that be called love?]
[The Master said, Can that which is hard to do be lightly spoken?]
[[Footnote 116: A disciple.]
[]\n\n4. Ssu-ma Niu asked, What is a gentleman?]
[The Master said, A gentleman knows neither sorrow nor fear.]
[No sorrow and no fear!]
[Can that be called a gentleman?]
[The Master said.]
[He searches his heart: it is blameless; so why should\nhe sorrow, what should he fear?]
[5. Ssu-ma Niu cried sadly, All men have brothers, I alone have none!]
[Tzu-hsia said, I have heard that life and death are allotted, that\nwealth and honours are in Heaven's hand.]
[A gentleman is careful and\ndoes not trip; he is humble towards others and courteous.]
[All within\nthe four seas are brethren; how can a gentleman lament that he has\nnone?]
[6. Tzu-chang asked, What is insight?]
[The Master said, Not to be moved by lap and wash of slander, or by\nplaints that pierce to the quick, may be called insight.]
[Yea, whom lap\nand wash of slander, or plaints that pierce to the quick cannot move\nmay be called far-sighted.]
[7. Tzu-kung asked, What is kingcraft?]
[The Master said, Food enough, troops enough, and the trust of the\npeople.]
[Tzu-kung said, If it had to be done, which could best be spared of the\nthree?]
[Troops, said the Master.]
[And if we had to, which could better be spared of the other two?]
[Food, said the Master.]
[From of old all men die, but without trust a\npeople cannot stand.]
[8. Chi Tzu-ch'eng[117] said, It is the stuff alone that makes a\ngentleman; what can art do for him?]
[Alas!]
[my lord, said Tzu-kung, how ye speak of a gentleman!]
[No team\novertakes the tongue!]
[The art is no less than the stuff, the stuff is\nno less than the art.]
[Without the fur, a tiger or a leopard's hide is\nno better than the hide of a dog or a goat.]
[9.]
[Duke Ai said to Yu Jo,[118] In this year of dearth I have not\nenough for my wants; what should be done?]
[Ye might tithe the people, answered Yu Jo.]
[A fifth is not enough, said the Duke, how could I do with a tenth?]
[When all his folk have enough, answered Yu Jo, shall the lord alone\nnot have enough?]
[When none of his folk have enough, shall the lord\nalone have enough?]
[10. Tzu-chang asked how to raise the mind and scatter delusions.]
[The Master said, Put faithfulness and truth first, and follow the\nright; the mind will be raised.]
[We wish life to what we love and death\nto what we hate.]
[To wish it both life and death is a delusion.]
[Whether prompted by wealth, or not,\n    Yet ye made a distinction.]
[[Footnote 117: Minister of Wei.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 118: A disciple of Confucius.]
[]\n\n11.]
[Ching,[119] Duke of Ch'i, asked Confucius, What is kingcraft?]
[Confucius answered.]
[For the lord to be lord and the liege, liege, the\nfather to be father and the son, son.]
[True indeed!]
[said the Duke.]
[If the lord were no lord and the liege no\nliege, the father no father and the son no son, though the grain were\nthere, could I get anything to eat?]
[12. The Master said, To stint a quarrel with half a word Yu[120] is\nthe man.]
[Tzu-lu never slept over a promise.]
[13. The Master said, At hearing lawsuits I am no better than others.]
[What is needed is to stop lawsuits.]
[14. Tzu-chang asked, What is kingcraft?]
[The Master said, To be tireless of thought and faithful in doing.]
[15. The Master said, Breadth of reading and the ties of courtesy will\nkeep us, too, from false paths.]
[16. The Master said, A gentleman shapes the good in man, he does not\nshape the bad in him.]
[The small man does the contrary.]
[17. Chi K'ang[121] asked Confucius how to rule.]
[Confucius answered, To rule is to set straight.]
[If ye give a straight\nlead, Sir, who will dare not go straight?]
[[Footnote 119: Confucius was in Ch'i in 517 B.C. The duke was\nover-shadowed by his ministers and thought of setting aside his eldest\nson.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 120: Tzu-lu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 121: On the death of Chi Huan, his brother Chi K'ang set\naside Chi Huan's small son and made himself head of the clan.]
[]\n\n18. Chi K'ang being troubled by robbers asked Confucius about it.]
[Confucius answered, If ye did not wish it, Sir, though ye rewarded him\nno man would steal.]
[19. Chi K'ang, speaking of kingcraft to Confucius, said, To help those\nthat follow the Way, should we kill the men that will not?]
[Confucius answered, Sir, what need has a ruler to kill?]
[If ye wished\nfor goodness, Sir, the people would be good.]
[The gentleman's mind is\nthe wind, and grass are the minds of small men: as the wind blows, so\nmust the grass bend.]
[20. Tzu-chang asked, What must a knight be, for him to be called\neminent?]
[The Master said, What dost thou mean by eminence?]
[Tzu-chang answered, To be famous in the state and famous in his home.]
[That is fame, not eminence, said the Master.]
[The eminent man is plain\nand straight, and loves right.]
[He weighs words and scans looks; he\ntakes pains to come down to men.]
[And he shall be eminent in the state\nand eminent in his house.]
[The famous man wears a mask of love, but his\ndeeds belie it.]
[Self-confident and free from doubts, fame will be his\nin the state and fame be his in his home.]
[21.]
[Whilst walking with the Master in the Rain God's glade Fan Ch'ih\nsaid to him, May I ask how to raise the mind, amend evil and scatter\nerrors?]
[Well asked!]
[said the Master.]
[Rank thy work above success, will not\nthe mind be raised?]
[Fight the bad in thee, not the bad in other men,\nwill not evil be mended?]
[One angry morning to forget both self and\nkin, is that no error?]
[22. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, To love men.]
[He asked, What is wisdom?]
[The Master said, To know men.]
[Fan Ch'ih did not understand.]
[The Master said, Lift up the straight, put by the crooked, and crooked\nmen will grow straight.]
[Fan Ch'ih withdrew, and seeing Tzu-hsia, said to him, The Master saw\nme and I asked him what wisdom is.]
[He answered, Lift up the straight,\nput by the crooked, and crooked men will grow straight.]
[What did he\nmean?]
[How rich a saying!]
[said Tzu-hsia.]
[When Shun[122] had all below heaven\nhe chose Kao-yao from the many, lifted him up, and the men without\nlove fled.]
[When T'ang[123] had all below heaven, he chose Yi-yin[124]\nfrom the many, lifted him up, and the men without love fled.]
[[Footnote 122: An emperor of the golden age.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 123: The founder of the Shang, or Yin, dynasty.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 124: T'ang's chief minister.]
[Yi-yin said, Whomsoever I\nserve, is he not my lord?]
[Whomsoever I rule, are they not my people?]
[He came in when there was order, and came in too when there were\ntumults.]
[He said, When Heaven begat the people, the man that first\nunderstood was sent to waken those slow to understand, and the man\nthat first woke was sent to waken those slow to wake.]
[I am he that\nwoke first among Heaven's people.]
[With the help of the Way, I shall\nwake the people!]
[For man or wife, of all the people below heaven, to\nhave missed the blessings of Yao and Shun was the same, he thought, as\nif he himself had pushed him into the ditch.]
[The burden he shouldered\nwas the weight of all below heaven.]
[(Mencius, Book X, chapter 1.]
[)]\n\n23. Tzu-kung asked about friends.]
[The Master said, Talk faithfully to them, and guide them well.]
[If this\nis no good, stop.]
[Do not bring shame upon thee.]
[24. Tseng-tzu said, A gentleman gathers friends by culture, and stays\nlove with friendship.]
[BOOK XIII\n\n\n1. Tzu-lu asked how to rule.]
[The Master said, Go before; work hard.]
[When asked to say more, he said, Never flag.]
[2.]
[When he was steward of the Chi, Chung-kung asked how to rule.]
[The Master said, Let officers act first; overlook small faults, lift\nup brains and worth.]
[Chung-kung said, How shall I get to know brains and worth to lift them\nup?]
[Lift up those thou dost know, said the Master; and those thou dost not\nknow, will other men pass by?]
[3. Tzu-lu said, The lord of Wei[125] waits for you, Sir, to govern.]
[How shall ye begin?]
[Surely, said the Master, by putting names right.]
[Indeed, said Tzu-lu, that is far-fetched, Sir.]
[Why put them right?]
[What a savage Yu[126] is!]
[said the Master.]
[A gentleman is tongue-tied\nwhen he does not understand.]
[If names are not right, words do not fit.]
[If words do not fit, affairs go wrong.]
[If affairs go wrong, neither\ncourtesy nor music thrive.]
[If courtesy and music do not thrive, law\nand justice fail.]
[And if law and justice fail them, the people can\nmove neither hand nor foot.]
[So a gentleman must be ready to put names\ninto speech and words into deed.]
[A gentleman is nowise careless of his\nwords.]
[[Footnote 125: See note to Book VII, Sec. 14. Tzu-lu was his officer.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 126: Tzu-lu.]
[]\n\n4. Fan Ch'ih asked to be taught husbandry.]
[The Master said.]
[An old husbandman knows more than I do.]
[He asked to be taught gardening.]
[The Master said.]
[An old gardener knows more than I do.]
[After Fan Ch'ih had gone, the Master said, How small a man!]
[If those\nabove love courtesy, no one will dare to slight them; if they love\nright, no one will dare to disobey; if they love truth, no one will\ndare to hide the heart.]
[Then, from the four corners of the earth, folk\nwill gather with their children on their backs; and what need will\nthere be for husbandry?]
[5. The Master said, Though a man have conned three hundred poems, if\nhe stands helpless when put to govern, if he cannot answer for himself\nwhen he is sent to the four corners of the earth, many as they are,\nwhat have they done for him?]
[6. The Master said, The man of upright life is obeyed before he\nspeaks; commands even go unheeded when the life is crooked.]
[7. The Master said, The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.]
[8. Speaking of Ching, of the ducal house of Wei, the Master said, He\nwas wise in his private life.]
[When he had begun to save, he said, This\nseems enough.]
[When he grew better off, he said, This seems plenty.]
[When he had grown rich, he said.]
[This seems splendour.]
[9.]
[When Jan Yu was driving him to Wei, the Master said.]
[What numbers!]
[Jan Yu said, Since numbers are here, what next is needed?]
[Wealth, said the Master.]
[And what comes next after wealth?]
[Teaching, said the Master.]
[10. The Master said, If I were employed for a twelve-month, much could\nbe done.]
[In three years all would be ended.]
[11. The Master said, If good men were to govern a land for an hundred\nyears, cruelty would be conquered and putting to death done away with.]
[How true are these words!]
[12. The Master said, Even if a king were to govern, a lifetime would\npass before love dawned!]
[13. The Master said, What is governing to a man that can rule himself?]
[If he cannot rule himself, how shall he rule others?]
[14.]
[As the disciple Jan[127] came back from court, the Master said to\nhim.]
[Why so late?]
[I had business of state, he answered.]
[Household business, said the Master.]
[If it had been business of state,\nthough I am out of office, I should have heard of it.]
[15.]
[Duke Ting asked, Is there any one saying that can bless a kingdom?]
[[Footnote 127: Jan Yu.]
[He was in the service of the Chi, not of the\nDuke of Lu.]
[]\n\nConfucius answered, That is more than words can do.]
[But men have a\nsaying, To be lord is hard and to be minister is not easy.]
[And if one\nknew how hard it is to be lord, might not this one saying almost bless\na kingdom?]
[And is there any one saying that can wreck a kingdom?]
[That is more than words can do, Confucius answered.]
[But men have a\nsaying, My only delight in being lord is that no one withstands what I\nsay.]
[Now if what he says is good, and no one withstands him, is not\nthat good too?]
[But if it is not good, and no one withstands him, might\nnot this one saying almost wreck a kingdom?]
[16. The Duke of She asked, What is kingcraft?]
[The Master answered, For those near us to be happy and those far off\nto come.]
[17.]
[When he was governor of Chue-fu, Tzu-hsia asked how to rule.]
[The Master said, Be not eager for haste; look not for small gains.]
[Nothing done in haste is thorough, and looking for small gains big\nthings are left undone.]
[18. The Duke of She told Confucius, Among the upright men of my clan\nif the father steals a sheep his son bears witness.]
[Confucius answered, Our clan's uprightness is unlike that.]
[The father\nscreens his son and the son screens his father.]
[There is uprightness\nin this.]
[19. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?]
[The Master said, To be humble at home, earnest at work, and faithful\nto all.]
[Even among wild tribes none of this must be dropped.]
[20. Tzu-kung asked, What is it that we call knighthood?]
[The Master said, To be called a knight, a man must be shamefast in all\nthat he does, if he is sent to the four corners of the earth he must\nnot disgrace his lord's commands.]
[May I ask who would come next?]
[He that his clansmen call a good son and his neighbours call modest.]
[And who would come next?]
[A man that clings to his word and sticks to his course, a flinty\nlittle fellow, would perhaps come next.]
[And how are the crown servants of to-day?]
[What!]
[The weights and measures men!]
[said the Master.]
[Are they worth\nreckoning?]
[21. The Master said, As I cannot get men of the middle way I have to\nfall back on zealous and austere men.]
[Zealous men push ahead and take\nthings up, and there are things that austere men will not do.]
[22. The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, 'Unless he is\nstable a man will make neither a wizard nor a leech.]
[' This is true.]
['His instability of mind may disgrace him.]
['\n\nThe Master said, Neglect of the omens, that is all.]
[23. The Master said, Gentlemen unite, but are not the same.]
[Small men\nare all the same, but each for himself.]
[24. Tzu-kung said, If the whole countryside loved a man, how would\nthat be?]
[It would not do, said the Master.]
[And how would it be, if the whole countryside hated him?]
[It would not do, said the Master.]
[It would be better if all the good\nmen of the countryside loved him and all the bad men hated him.]
[25. The Master said, A gentleman is easy to serve and hard to please.]
[If we go from the Way to please him, he is not pleased; but his\ncommands are measured to the man.]
[A small man is hard to serve and\neasy to please.]
[Though we go from the Way to please him, he is\npleased; but he expects everything of his men.]
[26. The Master said, A gentleman is high-minded, not proud; the small\nman is proud, but not high-minded.]
[27. The Master said, Strength and courage, simplicity and modesty are\nakin to love.]
[28. Tzu-lu asked, When can a man be called a knight?]
[The Master said, To be earnest, encouraging and kind may be called\nknighthood: earnest and encouraging with his friends, and kind to his\nbrothers.]
[29. The Master said, If a good man taught the people for seven years,\nthey would be fit to bear arms too.]
[30. The Master said, To take untaught men to war is called throwing\nthem away.]
[BOOK XIV\n\n\n1.]
[Hsien[128] asked, What is shame?]
[The Master said, To draw pay when the land keeps the Way and to draw\npay when it has lost the Way, is shame.]
[2.]
[To eschew strife and bragging, spite and greed, would that be love?]
[The Master said, That may be hard to do; but I do not know that it is\nlove.]
[3. The Master said, A knight that is fond of ease does not amount to a\nknight.]
[4. The Master said, Whilst the land keeps the Way, be fearless of\nspeech and fearless in deed; when the land has lost the Way, be\nfearless in deed but soft of speech.]
[5. The Master said, A man of mind can always talk, but talkers are not\nalways men of mind.]
[Love is always bold, though boldness is found\nwithout love.]
[6.]
[Nan-kung Kuo said to Confucius, Yi[129] shot well, Ao pushed a boat\nover land: each died before his time.]
[Yue and Chi toiled at their\ncrops, and had all below heaven.]
[The Master did not answer.]
[But when Nan-kung Kuo had gone, he said,\nWhat a gentleman he is!]
[How he honours mind!]
[[Footnote 128: The disciple Yuean Ssu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 129: Yi was killed by his best pupil, who said to himself,\nIn all the world no one but Yi shoots better than I do.]
[So he killed\nhim.]
[]\n\n7. The Master said, Alas!]
[there have been gentlemen without love!]
[But\nthere has never been a small man that was not wanting in love.]
[8. The Master said, Can he love thee that never tasks thee?]
[Can he be\nfaithful that never chides?]
[9. The Master said, The decrees were drafted by P'i Shen, criticised\nby Shih-shu, polished by the Foreign Minister Tzu-yue, and given the\nfinal touches by Tzu-ch'an of Tung-li.]
[10.]
[When he was asked what he thought of Tzu-ch'an, the Master said, A\nkind-hearted man.]
[Asked what he thought of Tzu-hsi, the Master said, Of him!]
[What I\nthink of him!]
[Asked what he thought of Kuan Chung,[130] the Master said, He was the\nman that drove the Po from the town of Pien with its three hundred\nhouseholds to end his days on coarse rice, without his muttering a\nword.]
[[Footnote 130: See note to Book III, Sec.]
[22.]
[]\n\n11. The Master said, Not to grumble at being poor is hard, not to be\nproud of wealth is easy.]
[12. The Master said, Meng Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be steward of\nChao or Wei, but he could not be minister of T'eng or Hsieh.]
[13. Tzu-lu asked what would make a full-grown man.]
[The Master said, The wisdom of Tsang Wu-chung, Kung-ch'o's lack of\ngreed, Chuang of Pien's boldness and the skill of Jan Ch'iu, graced by\ncourtesy and music, might make a full-grown man.]
[But now, he said, who asks the like of a full-grown man?]
[He that in\nsight of gain thinks of right, who when danger looms stakes his life,\nwho, though the bond be old, does not forget what he has been saying\nall his life, might make a full-grown man.]
[14. Speaking of Kung-shu Wen, the Master said to Kung-ming Chia, Is it\ntrue that thy master does not speak, nor laugh, nor take a gift?]
[Kung-ming Chia answered, That is saying too much.]
[My master only\nspeaks when the time comes, so no one tires of his speaking; he only\nlaughs when he is merry, so no one tires of his laughter; he only\ntakes when it is right to take, so no one tires of his taking.]
[It may be so, said the Master; but is it?]
[15. The Master said, When he held Fang and asked Lu to appoint an\nheir, though Tsang Wu-chung said he was not forcing his lord, I do not\nbelieve it.]
[16. The Master said, Duke Wen of Chin was deep, but dishonest; Duke\nHuan of Ch'i was honest, but shallow.]
[17. Tzu-lu said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Shao Hu\ndied with him, but Kuan Chung did not, was not this want of love?]
[[131]\n\n[Footnote 131: Chiu and Huan were brothers, sons of the Duke of Ch'i.]
[When their father died, their uncle seized the throne.]
[To preserve the\nrightful heir, Shao Hu and Kuan Chung fled with Chiu to Lu, whilst\nHuan escaped to another state.]
[Later on the usurper was murdered, and\nHuan returned to Ch'i and secured the throne.]
[He then required the\nDuke of Lu to kill his brother and deliver up to him Shao Hu and Kuan\nChung.]
[This was done.]
[But on the way to Ch'i Shao Hu killed himself.]
[Kuan Chung, on the other hand, took service under Duke Huan, became\nhis chief minister, and raised the state to greatness.]
[(See note to\nBook III, Sec.]
[22.]
[)]\n\nThe Master said, Duke Huan gathered the great vassals round him, not\nby chariots of war, but through the might of Kuan Chung.]
[What can love\ndo more?]
[What can love do more?]
[18. Tzu-kung said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Kuan\nChung could not face death and even became his minister, surely he\nshowed want of love?]
[The Master said, By Kuan Chung helping Duke Huan to put down the great\nvassals and make all below heaven one, men have fared the better from\nthat day to this.]
[But for Kuan Chung our hair would hang down our\nbacks and our coats would button to the left; or should he, like the\nbumpkin and his lass, their troth to keep, have drowned in a ditch,\nunknown to anyone?]
[19. The minister Hsien, who had been steward to Kung-shu Wen, went to\naudience of the Duke together with Wen.]
[When the Master heard of it, he said, He is rightly called Wen\n(well-bred).]
[20. The Master spake of Ling Duke of Wei's contempt for the Way.]
[K'ang[132] said, If this be so, how does he escape ruin?]
[Confucius answered, With Chung-shu Yue in charge of the guests, the\nreader T'o in charge of the Ancestral Temple, and Wang-sun Chia in\ncharge of the troops, how should he come to ruin?]
[21. The Master said, When words are unblushing, they are hard to make\ngood.]
[[Footnote 132: Chi K'ang.]
[]\n\n22.]
[Ch'en Ch'eng murdered Duke Chien.]
[[133]\n\nConfucius bathed, and went to court and told Duke Ai, saying, Ch'en\nHeng has murdered his lord: pray, punish him.]
[The Duke said, Tell the three chiefs.]
[Confucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not\nleave this untold; but the lord says, Tell the three chiefs.]
[He told the three chiefs.]
[It did no good.]
[Confucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not\nleave this untold.]
[23. Tzu-lu asked how to serve a lord.]
[The Master said, Never cheat him; stand up to him.]
[24. The Master said, A gentleman's life leads upwards; the small man's\nlife leads down.]
[25. The Master said, The men of old learned for their own sake; to-day\nmen learn for show.]
[26.]
[Ch'ue Po-yue sent a man to Confucius.]
[As they sat together, Confucius asked him, What does your master do?]
[He answered, My master wishes to make his faults fewer, but cannot.]
[When the messenger had left, the Master said, A messenger, a messenger\nindeed!]
[27. The Master said, When not in office discuss not policy.]
[[Footnote 133: 481 B.C., two years before the death of Confucius, who\nwas not at the time in office.]
[Chien was Duke of Ch'i, a state\nbordering on Lu.]
[The three chiefs were the heads of the three great\nclans that were all-powerful in Lu.]
[]\n\n28. Tseng-tzu said, Even in his thoughts, a gentleman does not outstep\nhis place.]
[29. The Master said, A gentleman is shamefast of speech: his deeds go\nfurther.]
[30. The Master said, In the way of the gentleman there are three\nthings that I cannot achieve.]
[Love is never troubled; wisdom has no\ndoubts; courage is without fear.]
[That is what ye say, Sir, said Tzu-kung.]
[31. Tzu-kung would liken this man to that.]
[The Master said, What talents Tz'u has!]
[Now I have no time for this.]
[32. The Master said, Sorrow not at being unknown; sorrow for thine own\nshortcomings.]
[33. The Master said, Not to expect to be cheated, nor to look for\nfalsehood, and yet to see them coming, shows worth in a man.]
[34.]
[Wei-sheng Mou said to Confucius, How dost thou still find roosts\nto roost on, Ch'iu, unless by wagging a glib tongue?]
[Confucius answered, I dare not wag a glib tongue; but I hate\nstubbornness.]
[35. The Master said, A steed is not praised for his strength, but\npraised for his mettle.]
[36.]
[One said, To mete out good for evil, how were that?]
[And how would ye meet good?]
[said the Master.]
[Meet evil with justice;\nmeet good with good.]
[37. The Master said, Alas!]
[no man knows me!]
[Tzu-kung said, Why do ye\nsay, Sir, that no man knows you?]
[The Master said, Never murmuring against Heaven, nor finding fault\nwith men; learning from the lowest, cleaving the heights.]
[I am known\nbut to one, but to Heaven.]
[38.]
[Liao, the duke's uncle, spake ill of Tzu-lu to Chi-sun.]
[[134]\n\nTzu-fu Ching-po told this to Confucius, saying, My master's mind is\nsurely being led astray by the duke's uncle, but I have still the\nstrength to expose his body in the market-place.]
[The Master said, If the Way is to be kept, that is the Bidding, and if\nthe Way is to be lost, this is the Bidding.]
[What can the duke's uncle\ndo against the Bidding?]
[39. The Master said, Men of worth flee the world; the next best flee\nthe land.]
[Then come those that go at a look, then those that go at\nwords.]
[40. The Master said, Seven men did so.]
[41. Tzu-lu spent a night at Shih-men.]
[The gate-keeper asked him, Whence comest thou?]
[From Confucius, answered Tzu-lu.]
[The man that knows it is no good and yet must still be doing?]
[said the\ngate-keeper.]
[42.]
[When the Master was chiming his sounding stones in Wei, a\nbasket-bearer said, as he passed the door, The heart is full that\nchimes those stones!]
[But then he said, For shame!]
[What a tinkling\nsound!]
[If no one knows thee, have done!]
[Wade the deep places,\n    Lift thy robe through the shallows!]
[[Footnote 134: The head of the Chi clan, in whose service Tzu-lu\nwas.]
[]\n\nThe Master said, Where there's a will, that is nowise hard.]
[43. Tzu-chang said, What does the Book mean by saying that\nKao-tsung[135] in his mourning shed did not speak for three years?]
[Why pick out Kao-tsung?]
[said the Master.]
[The men of old were all thus.]
[For three years after their lord had died, the hundred officers did\neach his duty and hearkened to the chief minister.]
[44. The Master said, When those above love courtesy, the people are\neasy to lead.]
[45. Tzu-lu asked, What makes a gentleman?]
[The Master said, To be bent on becoming better.]
[Is that all?]
[said Tzu-lu.]
[By becoming better to bring peace to men.]
[And is that all?]
[By becoming better to bring peace to all men, said the Master.]
[Even\nYao and Shun were still struggling to become better, and so bring\npeace to all men.]
[46.]
[Yuean Jang awaited the Master squatting.]
[Unruly when young, unmentioned as man, undying when old, spells\ngood-for-nothing!]
[said the Master, and he hit him on the leg with his\nstaff.]
[47.]
[When a lad from the village of Ch'ueeh was made messenger, someone\nasked, saying, Is it because he is doing well?]
[The Master said, I have seen him sitting in a man's seat, and seen him\nwalking abreast of his elders.]
[He does not try to do well: he wishes\nto be quickly grown up.]
[[Footnote 135: An emperor of the Yin dynasty.]
[]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XV\n\n\n1.]
[Ling, Duke of Wei, asked Confucius about the line of battle.]
[Confucius answered.]
[Of the ritual of dish and platter[136] I have\nheard somewhat: I have not learnt warfare.]
[He left the next day.]
[In Ch'en grain ran out.]
[His followers were too ill to rise.]
[Tzu-lu\nshowed that he was put out.]
[Has a gentleman to face want too?]
[he said.]
[Gentlemen have indeed to face want, said the Master.]
[The small man,\nwhen he is in want, runs to excess.]
[2. The Master said, Tz'u,[137] dost thou not take me for a man that\nhas learnt much and thought it over?]
[Yes, he answered: is it not so?]
[No, said the Master.]
[I string all into one.]
[3. The Master said, Yu,[138] how few men know great-heartedness!]
[[Footnote 136: For sacrifice.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 137: Tzu-kung.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 138: Tzu-lu: probably said to him on the occasion mentioned\nin Sec.]
[I.]
[]\n\n4. The Master said, To rule doing nothing, was what Shun did.]
[For what\nis there to do?]
[Self-respect and to set the face to rule, is all.]
[5. Tzu-chang asked how to get on.]
[The Master said, Be faithful and true of word, plain and lowly in thy\nwalk; thou wilt get on even in tribal lands.]
[If thy words be not\nfaithful and true, thy walk not plain and lowly, wilt thou get on\neven in thine own town?]
[Standing, see these words ranged before thee;\ndriving, see them written upon the yoke.]
[Then thou wilt get on.]
[Tzu-chang wrote them on his girdle.]
[6. The Master said, Straight indeed was the historian Yue!]
[Like an\narrow whilst the land kept the Way; and like an arrow when it lost the\nWay!]
[What a gentleman was Ch'ue Po-yue!]
[Whilst the land kept the Way he\ntook office, and when the land had lost the Way he rolled himself up\nin thought.]
[7. The Master said, Not to speak to him that has ears to hear is to\nspill the man.]
[To speak to a man without ears to hear is to spill thy\nwords.]
[Wisdom spills neither man nor words.]
[8. The Master said, A high will, or a loving heart, will not seek life\nat cost of love.]
[To fulfil love they will kill the body.]
[9. Tzu-kung asked how to attain to love.]
[The Master said, A workman bent on good work must first sharpen his\ntools.]
[In the land that is thy home, serve those that are worthy among\nthe great and make friends with loving knights.]
[10.]
[Yen Yuean asked how to rule a kingdom.]
[The Master said, Follow the Hsia seasons, drive in the chariot of Yin,\nwear the head-dress of Chou, take for music the Shao and its dance.]
[Banish the strains of Cheng and flee men that are glib; for the\nstrains of Cheng are wanton and glib speakers are dangerous.]
[11. The Master said.]
[Without thought for far off things, there shall\nbe trouble near at hand.]
[12. The Master said, All is ended!]
[I have seen no one that loves mind\nas he loves looks!]
[13. The Master said, Did not Tsang Wen filch his post?]
[He knew the\nworth of Liu-hsia Hui,[139] and did not stand by him.]
[14. The Master said, By asking much of self and little of other men\nill feeling is banished.]
[15. The Master said, Unless a man say, Would this do?]
[Would that do?]
[I\ncan do nothing for him.]
[16. The Master said, When all day long there is no talk of right, and\nlittle wiles find favour, the company is in hard case.]
[17. The Master said, Right is the stuff of which a gentleman is made.]
[Done with courtesy, spoken with humility, rounded with truth, right\nmakes a gentleman.]
[18. The Master said, His shortcomings trouble a gentleman; to be\nunknown does not trouble him.]
[19. The Master said, A gentleman fears that his name shall be no more\nheard when life is done.]
[[Footnote 139: Another of these _seigneurs du temps jadis_ that is\nmore to us than a dim shadow, for he still lives in the pages of\nMencius, who tells us that, He was not ashamed of a foul lord, and did\nnot refuse a small post.]
[On coming in he did not hide his worth, but\nheld his own way.]
[Neglected and idle, he did not grumble; straitened\nand poor, he did not mope.]
[When brought together with country folk he\nwas quite at his ease and could not bear to leave them.]
[Thou art thou,\nhe said, and I am I: standing beside me with thy coat off, or thy body\nnaked, how canst thou defile me?]
[(Book X, chapter 1).]
[He stopped if a\nhand was raised to stop him, for he did not care whether he went or no\n(Book III, chapter 9).]
[]\n\n20. The Master said, A gentleman asks of himself, the small man asks\nof others.]
[21. The Master said, A gentleman is firm, not quarrelsome; a friend,\nnot a partisan.]
[22. The Master said, A gentleman does not raise a man for his words,\nnor spurn the speech for the man.]
[23. Tzu-kung said, Is there one word by which we may walk till life\nends?]
[The Master said, Fellow-feeling, perhaps.]
[Do not do unto others what\nthou wouldst not have done to thee.]
[24. The Master said, Of the men that I meet, whom do I cry down, whom\ndo I overpraise?]
[Or, if I overpraise them, it is after testing them.]
[It was owing to this people that the three lines of kings went the\nstraight way.]
[25. The Master said, I have still known historians that would leave a\ngap in their text, and men that would lend a horse to another to ride.]
[Now it is so no more.]
[26. The Master said, Cunning words confound the mind; petty impatience\nconfounds great projects.]
[27. The Master said, The hatred of the many must be looked into; the\nlove of the many must be looked into.]
[28. The Master said, The man can exalt the Way: it is not the Way that\nexalts the man.]
[29. The Master said, The fault is to cleave to a fault.]
[30. The Master said, I have spent whole days without food and whole\nnights without sleep, thinking, and gained nothing by it.]
[Learning is\nbetter.]
[31. The Master said, A gentleman thinks of the Way; he does not think\nof food.]
[Sow, and famine may follow; learn, and pay may come; but a\ngentleman grieves for the Way; to be poor does not grieve him.]
[32. The Master said, What wisdom has got will be lost again, unless\nlove hold it fast.]
[Wisdom to get and love to hold fast, without\ndignity of bearing, will not be honoured among men.]
[Wisdom to get,\nlove to hold fast and dignity of bearing, without courteous ways are\nnot enough.]
[33. The Master said, A gentleman has no small knowledge, but he can\ncarry out big things: the small man can carry out nothing big, but he\nmay be knowing in small things.]
[34. The Master said, Love is more to the people than fire and water.]
[I\nhave seen men come to their death by fire and water: I have seen no\nman that love brought to his death.]
[35. The Master said, When love is at stake yield not to an army.]
[36. The Master said, A gentleman is consistent, not changeless.]
[37. The Master said, A servant of the king honours his work, and puts\nfood after it.]
[38. The Master said, Learning knows no rank.]
[39. The Master said, Mingle not in projects with a man whose way is\nnot thine.]
[40. The Master said, The whole end of speech is to be understood.]
[41.]
[When he saw the music-master Mien, the Master said, as they came\nto the steps, Here are the steps.]
[On coming to the mat, he said, Here\nis the mat.]
[When all were seated, the Master told him, He and he are\nhere.]
[After the music-master had gone, Tzu-chang said, Is this the way to\nspeak to a music-master?]
[The Master said, Surely it is the way to help a music-master.]
[[140]\n\n[Footnote 140: The man being blind, as so many musicians are in the\nEast.]
[]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVI\n\n\n1. The Chi was about to make war on Chuan-yue.]
[[141]\n\nWhen Confucius saw Jan Yu and Chi-lu,[142] they said to him, The Chi\nis going to deal with Chuan-yue.]
[Confucius said, After all, Ch'iu,[143] art thou not in the wrong?]
[The\nkings of old made Chuan-yue lord of Tung Meng.]
[[144] Moreover, as\nChuan-yue is inside our borders it is the liege of the spirits of earth\nand corn of our land; so how can ye make war upon it?]
[Jan Yu said, Our master wishes it.]
[Tzu-lu and I, his two ministers, do\nnot, either of us, wish it.]
[Confucius said, Ch'iu, Chou Jen used to say, 'He that can put forth\nhis strength takes his place in the line; he that cannot stands back.]
['\nWho would take to help him a man that is no stay in danger and no\nsupport in falling?]
[Moreover, what thou sayest is wrong.]
[If a tiger or\na buffalo escapes from his pen, if tortoiseshell or jade is broken in\nits case, who is to blame?]
[Jan Yu said, But Chuan-yue is now strong, and it is near to Pi[145]; if\nit is not taken now, in days to come it will bring sorrow on our sons\nand grandsons.]
[[Footnote 141: A small feudatory state of Lu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 142: Tzu-lu.]
[He and Jan Yu were in the service of the Chi.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 143: Jan Yu.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 144: A mountain in Chuan-yue.]
[Since the Emperor had given the\nruler of Chuan-yue the right to sacrifice to its mountains, that state\nhad some measure of independence, though it was feudatory to Lu, and\nwithin its borders.]
[]\n\n[Footnote 145: A town belonging to the Chi.]
[]\n\nCh'iu, said Confucius, instead of saying 'I want it,' a gentleman\nhates to plead that he needs must.]
[I have heard that fewness of men\ndoes not vex a king or a chief, but unlikeness of lot vexes him.]
[Poverty does not vex him, but want of peace vexes him.]
[For if wealth\nwere even, no one would be poor.]
[In harmony is number; peace prevents\na fall.]
[Thus, if far off tribes will not submit, bring them in by\nencouraging mind and art, and when they come in give them peace.]
[But\nnow, when far off tribes will not submit, ye two, helpers of your\nlord, cannot bring them in.]
[The kingdom is split and falling, and ye\ncannot save it.]
[Yet inside our land ye plot to move spear and shield!]
[The sorrows of Chi's grandsons will not rise in Chuan-yue, I fear: they\nwill rise within the palace wall.]
[2.]
[Confucius said, When the Way is kept below heaven, courtesy, music\nand punitive wars flow from the Son of heaven.]
[When the Way is lost\nbelow heaven, courtesy, music and punitive wars flow from the great\nvassals.]
[When they flow from the great vassals they will rarely last\nfor ten generations.]
[When they flow from the great ministers they will\nrarely last for five generations.]
[When underlings sway the country's\nfate they will rarely last for three generations.]
[When the Way is kept\nbelow heaven power does not lie with the great ministers.]
[When the Way\nis kept below heaven common folk do not argue.]
[3.]
[Confucius said, For five generations its income has passed from the\nducal house;[146] for four generations power has lain with the great\nministers: and humbled, therefore, are the sons and grandsons of the\nthree Huan.]
[[Footnote 146: Of Lu.]
[]\n\n4.]
[Confucius said, There are three friends that help us, and three\nthat do us harm.]
[The friends that help us are a straight friend, an\noutspoken friend, and a friend that has heard much.]
[The friends that\nharm us are plausible friends, friends that like to flatter, and\nfriends with a glib tongue.]
[5.]
[Confucius said, There are three delights that do good, and three\nthat do us harm.]
[Those that do good are delight in dissecting good\nform and music, delight in speaking of the good in men, and delight in\nhaving many worthy friends.]
[Those that do harm are proud delights,\ndelight in idle roving, and delight in the joys of the feast.]
[6.]
[Confucius said.]
[Men that wait upon lords fall into three mistakes.]
[To speak before the time has come is rashness.]
[Not to speak when the\ntime has come is secrecy.]
[To speak heedless of looks is blindness.]
[7.]
[Confucius said, A gentleman has three things to guard against.]
[In the days of thy youth, ere thy strength is steady, beware of lust.]
[When manhood is reached, in the fulness of strength, beware of strife.]
[In old age, when thy strength is broken, beware of greed.]
[8.]
[Confucius said, A gentleman holds three things in awe.]
[He is in\nawe of the Bidding of Heaven; he is in awe of great men; and he is\nawed by the words of the holy.]
[The small man knows not the Bidding of Heaven, and holds it not in\nawe.]
[He is saucy towards the great; he makes game of holy men's words.]
[9.]
[Confucius said, The best men are born wise.]
[Next come those that\ngrow wise by learning; then those that learn from toil.]
[Those that do\nnot learn from toil are the lowest of the people.]
[10.]
[Confucius said, A gentleman has nine aims.]
[To see clearly; to\nunderstand what he hears; to be warm in manner, dignified in bearing,\nfaithful of speech, keen at work; to ask when in doubt; in anger to\nthink of difficulties; and in sight of gain to think of right.]
[11.]
[Confucius said, In sight of good to be filled with longing; to\nlook on evil as scalding to the touch: I have seen such men, I have\nheard such words.]
[To live apart and search thy will; to achieve thy Way, by doing right:\nI have heard these words, but I have seen no such men.]

[I answered, No.]
[He that\ndoes not learn poetry, he said, has no hold on words.]
[I withdrew and\nlearned poetry.]
[Another day, when he again stood alone and I sped across the hall, he\nsaid to me, Art thou learning courtesy?]
[I answered, No.]
[He that does\nnot learn courtesy, he said, has no foothold.]
[I withdrew and learned\ncourtesy.]
[These two things I have heard.]

[He sent Confucius a sucking pig.]
[Confucius chose a time when he\nwas out, and went to thank him.]
[They met on the road.]
[He said to Confucius, Come, let us speak together.]
[To cherish a gem,\nand undo the kingdom, can that be called love?]
[It cannot, said Confucius.]
[To love office, and miss the hour again and again, can that be called\nwisdom?]
[It cannot, said Confucius.]
[The days and months go by; the years do not wait for us.]
[True, said Confucius; I must take office.]

[Could I not make\nan Eastern Chou[155] of him that uses me?]
[6. Tzu-chang asked Confucius what is love.]
[Confucius said, Love is to mete out five things to all below heaven.]
[May I ask what they are?]
[Modesty and bounty, said Confucius, truth, earnestness and kindness.]
[Modesty escapes insult: bounty wins the many; truth gains men's trust;\nearnestness brings success; and kindness is enough to make men work.]
[7.]
[Pi Hsi called the Master, who wished to go.]
[Tzu-lu said, Master, I heard you say once, To men whose own life is\nevil, no gentleman will go.]
[Pi Hsi holds Chung-mou in rebellion; how\ncould ye go to him, Sir?]

[He answered.]
[No.]
[Sit down, and I shall tell thee.]
[The thirst for love, without love of\nlearning, sinks into simpleness.]
[Love of knowledge, without love of\nlearning, sinks into vanity.]
[Love of truth, without love of learning,\nsinks into cruelty.]
[Love of straightness, without love of learning,\nsinks into rudeness.]
[Love of daring, without love of learning, sinks\ninto turbulence.]
[Love of strength, without love of learning, sinks\ninto oddity.]
[9. The Master said, My little children, why do ye not learn poetry?]
[Poetry would ripen you; teach you insight, friendliness and\nforbearance; show you how to serve your father at home; and teach your\nlord abroad; and it would teach you the names of many birds and\nbeasts, plants and trees.]
[10. The Master said to Po-yue,[157] Hast thou done the Chou-nan and\nShao-nan?]
[[158] He that has not done the Chou-nan and Shao-nan is like\na man standing with his face to the wall.]
[11. The Master said, 'Courtesy, courtesy,' is the cry; but are jade\nand silk the whole of courtesy?]
['Music, music,' is the cry; but are\nbells and drums the whole of music?]

[15. The Master said, How can we serve the king with a low fellow, who\nis itching to get what he wants and trembling to lose what he has?]
[This trembling to lose what he has may lead him anywhere.]
[16. The Master said, Men of old had three failings, which have,\nperhaps, died out to-day.]
[Ambitious men of old were not nice; now they\nare unprincipled.]
[Stern men of old were hard; now they are\nquarrelsome.]
[Ignorant men of old were straight; now they are false.]

[18. The Master said, I hate the ousting of scarlet by purple.]
[I hate\nthe strains of Cheng, confounders of sweet music.]
[I hate a sharp\ntongue, the ruin of kingdom and home.]

[He thought that\none was enough.]
[If for three years gentlemen forsake courtesy, courtesy must suffer.]
[If for three years they forsake music, music must decay.]
[The old grain\npasses, the new grain sprouts, the round of woods for the fire-drill\nis ended in one year.]
[The Master said, Feeding on rice, clad in brocade, couldst thou be at\nrest?]
[I could, he answered.]
[Then do what gives thee rest.]
[But a gentleman, when he is mourning,\nhas no taste for sweets and no ear for music; he cannot rest in his\nhome.]
[So he gives these up.]
[Now, they give thee rest; then keep them.]

[Could he not play at chequers?]
[Even that were better.]
[23. Tzu-lu said, Do gentlemen honour daring?]
[They put right higher, said the Master.]
[With daring and no sense of\nright gentlemen turn rebels and small men turn robbers.]
[24. Tzu-kung said, Do gentlemen hate too?]

[]\n\n[Footnote 160: Tsai Wo.]

[And Tz'u,[161] he said, dost thou hate too?]
[I hate those that take spying for wisdom, who take want of manners for\ncourage, and take tale-telling for honesty.]

[He answered, If I serve men the straight way, where can I go without\nbeing dismissed thrice?]
[If I am to serve men the crooked way, why\nshould I leave the land of my father and mother?]
[3. Speaking of how to treat Confucius, Ching, Duke of Ch'i, said, I\ncannot treat him as I do the Chi.]
[I put him between Chi and Meng.]

[Up and away!]
[The Court is today\n      With danger attended.]

[Ch'ang-chue and Chieh-ni were working in the fields.]
[As Confucius\npassed them, he sent Tzu-lu to ask for the ford.]
[Ch'ang-chue said, Who is that holding the reins?]
[He is K'ung Ch'iu, said Tzu-lu.]
[Is he K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?]
[Yes, said Tzu-lu.]

[Yes, he answered.]
[All below heaven is seething and boiling, said Chieh-ni, who can\nchange it?]
[How much better would it be to follow a knight that flees\nthe world than to follow a knight that flees persons!]
[And he went on hoeing without stop.]
[Tzu-lu went and told the Master, whose face fell.]
[Can I herd with birds and beasts?]
[he said.]
[Whom but these men can I\ntake as fellows?]
[And if the Way were kept by all below heaven, I\nshould not need to change them.]
[7. Tzu-lu, who was following behind, met an old man carrying a basket\non his staff.]
[Tzu-lu asked him, Have ye seen the Master, Sir?]
[The old man answered, Thy four limbs are idle, thou canst not sort the\nfive seeds: who is thy Master?]
[And he planted his staff, and weeded.]
[Tzu-lu stood and bowed.]
[He kept Tzu-lu for the night, killed a fowl, made millet, gave them\nhim to eat, and presented his two sons.]
[Tzu-lu left the next day, and told the Master.]
[The Master said, He is in hiding.]
[He sent Tzu-lu back to see him; but when he arrived he had gone.]
[Tzu-lu said, Not to take office is not right.]
[If the ties of old and\nyoung cannot be thrown off, how can he throw off the liege's duty to\nhis lord?]
[He wishes to keep his life clean, but he is unsettling the\nbonds between men.]
[To discharge that duty a gentleman takes office,\nthough he knows beforehand that the Way will not be kept.]
[8.]
[Po-yi, Shu-ch'i, Yue-chung, Yi-yi, Chu-chang, Liu-hsia Hui and\nShao-lien were men that hid from the world.]

[Chih, the Great Music-master, went to Ch'i; Kan, the conductor at\nthe second meal, went to Ch'u; Liao, the conductor at the third meal,\nwent to Ts'ai; Chueeh, the conductor at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.]

[2. Tzu-hsia said, Goodness, clutched too narrowly; a belief in the Way\nwhich is not honest; can they be said to be, or said not to be?]
[3. The disciples of Tzu-hsia asked Tzu-chang whom we should choose as\nour companions.]
[Tzu-chang said.]
[What does Tzu-hsia say?]
[They answered, Tzu-hsia says, If the men be well for thee, go with\nthem; if they be not well, push them off.]
[Tzu-chang said.]
[This is not the same as what I had heard.]
[A gentleman\nhonours worth and bears with the many.]
[He applauds goodness and pities\nweakness.]
[If I were a man of great worth, what could I not bear with\nin others?]
[If I am without worth, men will push me off: why should I\npush other men off?]
[4. Tzu-hsia said, Though there must be things worth seeing along small\nways, a gentleman does not follow them, for fear of being left at last\nin the mire.]
[5. Tzu-hsia said, He that each day remembers his failings and each\nmonth forgets nothing won may be said to love learning indeed!]
[6. Tzu-hsia said, By wide learning and singleness of will, by keen\nquestions and home thinking we reach love.]
[7. Tzu-hsia said, To master the hundred trades, apprentices work in a\nshop; by learning, a gentleman finds his way.]
[8. Tzu-hsia said, The small man must always gloss his faults.]
[9. Tzu-hsia said, A gentleman changes thrice.]
[Looking up to him he\nseems stern; as we draw near, he warms; but his speech, when we hear\nit, is sharp.]
[10. Tzu-hsia said, Until they trust him, a gentleman lays no burdens\non his people.]
[If they do not trust him, they will think it cruel.]
[Until they trust him, he does not chide them.]
[Unless they trust him,\nit will seem fault-finding.]
[11. Tzu-hsia said, If we keep within the bounds of honour, we can step\nto and fro through propriety.]
[12. Tzu-yu said, The disciples, the little sons of Tzu-hsia, can\nsprinkle and sweep, attend and answer, come in and go out; but what\ncan come of twigs without roots?]
[When Tzu-hsia heard this, he said, Yen Yu[173] is wrong.]
[If we teach\none thing in the way of a gentleman first, shall we tire before\nreaching the next?]
[Thus plants and trees differ in size.]
[Should the\nway of a gentleman bewilder him?]
[To learn it, first and last, none but\nthe holy are fit.]
[[Footnote 173: Tzu-yu.]
[]\n\n13. Tzu-hsia said, A servant of the crown should give his spare\nstrength to learning.]
[With his spare strength a scholar should serve\nthe crown.]
[14. Tzu-yu said, Mourning should stretch to grief, and stop there.]
[15. Tzu-yu said, Our friend Chang[174] can do hard things, but love is\nnot yet his.]
[16. Tseng-tzu said, Chang is so spacious, so lordly, that at his side\nit is hard to do what love bids.]
[17. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, Man never shows what\nis in him unless it be in mourning those dear to him.]
[18. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, In all else we may be\nas good a son as Meng Chuang, but in not changing his father's\nministers, or his father's rule, he is hard to match.]
[19. The Meng[175] made Yang Fu[176] Chief Knight,[177] who spake to\nTseng-tzu about it.]
[Tseng-tzu said, Those above have lost their way, the people have long\nbeen astray.]
[When thou dost get at the truth, be moved to pity, not\npuffed with joy.]
[20. Tzu-kung said, Chou[178] was not so very wicked!]
[Thus a gentleman\nhates to live in a hollow, down into which runs all that is foul below\nheaven.]

[Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tzu-kung, From whom did Chung-ni[180]\nlearn?]
[Tzu-kung said, The Way of Wen and Wu[181] has not fallen into ruin.]
[It\nlives in men: the big in big men, the small in small men.]
[In none of\nthem is the Way of Wen and Wu missing.]
[How should the Master not learn\nit?]
[What need had he for a set teacher?]
[23.]
[In talk with the great men of the court Shu-sun Wu-shu[182] said,\nTzu-kung is worthier than Chung-ni.]
[Tzu-fu Ching-po told this to Tzu-kung.]
[Tzu-kung said, This is like the palace wall.]
[My wall reaches to the\nshoulder: peeping over you see the good home within.]
[The Master's wall\nis several fathoms high: no one can see the beauty of the Ancestral\nTemple and the wealth of its hundred officers, unless he gets in by\nthe gate.]
[And if only a few men find the gate, may not my lord have\nspoken the truth?]
[24.]
[Shu-sun Wu-shu cried down Chung-ni.]
[Tzu-kung said, It is labour lost.]
[Chung-ni cannot be cried down.]
[The\ngreatness of other men is a hummock, over which we can still leap.]
[Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which no one can overleap.]
[Though the man\nwere willing to kill himself, how could he hurt the sun or moon?]
[That\nhe does not know his own measure would only be seen the better!]

[]\n\n2. Tzu-chang asked Confucius, How should men be governed?]
[The Master said, To govern men we must honour five fair things and\nspurn four evil things.]
[Tzu-chang said, What are the five fair things?]
[The Master said, A gentleman is kind, but not wasteful; he burdens,\nbut he does not embitter; he is covetous, but not greedy; high-minded,\nbut not proud; stern, but not fierce.]
[Tzu-chang said, What is meant by kindness without waste?]
[The Master said, To further what furthers the people, is not that\nkindness without waste?]
[If burdens be sorted to strength, who will\ngrumble?]
[To covet love and get love, is that greed?]
[Few or many, small\nor great, all is one to a gentleman: he dares not slight any man.]
[Is\nnot this to be high-minded, but not proud?]
[A gentleman straightens his\nrobe and cap, and settles his look.]
[He is severe, and men look up to\nhim with awe.]
[Is not this to be stern, but not fierce?]
[Tzu-chang said, What are the four evil things?]
[The Master said, To leave untaught and then kill is cruelty; not to\ngive warning and to expect things to be done is tyranny; to give\ncareless orders and be strict when the day comes is robbery; to be\nstingy in rewarding men is littleness.]
[3. The Master said, He that does not know the Bidding cannot be a\ngentleman.]
[Not to know good form is to have no foothold.]
[Not to know\nwords is to know nothing of men.]

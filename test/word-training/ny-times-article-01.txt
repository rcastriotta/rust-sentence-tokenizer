that

was

successful
,
given
that

here
has
become
one

in

country.
at

a

of

residents
were
not
placed
in

and
are
now
wondering
where
to

an

it

this

"

a

but
resources
to

with
that

have
dwindled
as
well.
in

,
redevelopment
funds
from
the
state
had
been
a

,
but
when
california
was

deficits
in

,
its
governor

did
away
with

leslye

the

director
,
said
that
in

$40.6

be
used
for

now
that
money
is
spent.
from
all
sources
,
federal
,
state

,
the

funds
for

have
dropped
by
a

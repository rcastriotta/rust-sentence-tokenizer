western
part

shantung.
his
name
was
k
'ung
ch
'iu
,
and
his
style
(
corresponding
to
our

was
chung-ni.
his
countrymen
speak
of
him
as
k
'ung
fu-tzu
,
the
master
,
or
philosopher
k
'ung.
this
expression
was
altered
into
confucius
by
the
jesuit
missionaries
who
first
carried
his
fame
to
europe.

since
the
golden
days
of
the
emperors
yao
and
shun
,
the
legendary
founders
of
the
chinese
empire
,
nearly
two
thousand
years
had
passed.
shun
chose
as
his
successor
yue
,
who
had
been
his
chief
minister
,
a
man
whose
devotion
to
duty
was
such
that
when
engaged
in
draining
the
empire
of
the
great
flood
--
a
task
that
took
eight
years
to
accomplish
--
he
never
entered
his
home
till
the
work
was
done
,
although
in
the
course
of
his
labours
he
had
thrice
to
pass
his
door.
he
founded
the
hsia
dynasty
,
which
lasted
till
##number##
b.c.
the
last
emperor
of
this
line
,
a
vile
tyrant
,
was
overthrown
by
t
'ang
,
who
became
the
first
ruler
of
the
house
of
shang
,
or
yin.
this
dynasty
again
degenerated
in
course
of
time
and
came
to
an
end
in
chou
,
or
chou
hsin
(
##number##
b.c.
)
,
a
monster
of
lust
,
extravagance
,
and
cruelty.
the
empire
was
only
held
together
by
the
strength
and
wisdom
of
the
duke
of
chou
,
or
king
wen
,
to
give
him
his
popular
title
,
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
chinese
history.
he
controlled
two-thirds
of
the
empire
;
but
,
believing
that
the
people
were
not
yet
ready
for
a
change
,
he
refrained
from
dethroning
the
emperor.
in
his
day
'the
husbandman
paid
one
in
nine
;
the
pay
of
the
officers
was
hereditary
;
men
were
questioned
at
barriers
and
at
markets
,
but
there
were
no
tolls
;
fishgarths
were
not
preserved
;
the
children
of
criminals
were
sackless.
the
old
and
wifeless
--
the
widower
;
the
old
and
husbandless
--
the
widow
;
the
old
and
childless
--
the
lone
one
;
the
young
and
fatherless
--
the
orphan
;
these
four
are
the
people
most
in
need
below
heaven
,
and
they
have
no
one
to
whom
to
cry
,
so
when
king
wen
reigned
his
love
went
out
first
to
them
'
(
mencius

##number##
)
.
after
his
death
,
his
son
,
king
wu
,
decided
that
the
nation
was
ripe
for
change.
he
overcame
chou
hsin
by
force
of
arms
,
and
,
placing
himself
on
the
throne
,
became
the
founder
of
the
chou
dynasty.
in
the
time
of
confucius
the
chou
dynasty
still
filled
the
throne.
but
it
had
long
since
become
effete
,
and
all
power
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
great
vassals.
the
condition
of
china
was
much
like
that
of
germany
in
the
worst
days
of
the
holy
roman
empire.
the
emperor
was
powerless
,
the
various
vassal
states
were
independent
in
all
but
name
,
and
often
at
war
one
with
the
other.
these
states
again
were
disintegrated
,
and
their
rulers
impotent
against
encroaching
feudatories.
in
confucius
'
native
state
,
lu
,
the
duke
was
a
mere
shadow.
the
younger
branches
of
his
house
had
usurped
all
power.
three
in
number
,
they
were
called
the
three
clans.
the
most
important
of
the
three
was
the
chi
,
or
chi-sun
clan
,
whose
chiefs
chi
huan
and
chi
k
'ang
are
often
mentioned
by
confucius.
but
the
power
of
the
chi
,
too
,
was
ill-secured.
the
minister
yang
huo
overawed
his
master
,
and
once
even
threw
him
into
prison.
nor
was
the
condition
of
the
other
states
of
the
empire
better
than
that
of
lu.
confucius
thought
it
worse.
into
this
turbulent
world
confucius
was
born.
though
his
father
was
only
a
poor
military
officer
,
he
could
trace
his
descent
from
the
imperial
house
of
yin.
confucius
married
at
nineteen
,
and
is
known
to
have
had
one
son
and
one
daughter.
shortly
after
his
marriage
he
entered
the
service
of
the
state
as
keeper
of
the
granary.
a
year
later
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
public
fields.
in
##number##
b.c.
his
mother
died
,
and
,
in
obedience
to
chinese
custom
,
he
had
to
retire
from
public
life.
when
the
years
of
mourning
were
over
,
he
did
not
again
take
office
,
but
devoted
himself
instead
to
study
and
teaching.
as
the
years
rolled
by
his
fame
grew
,
and
a
band
of
pupils
gathered
round
him.
in
##number##
b.c.
the
anarchy
in
lu
reached
such
a
pitch
that
confucius
moved
to
the
neighbouring
land
of
ch
'i.
here
he
had
several
interviews
with
the
reigning
duke
,
but
met
with
little
encouragement
(
xviii.
##number##
)
.
so
he
soon
returned
to
his
native
country
,
and
resumed
for
fifteen
years
his
work
as
student
and
teacher.
during
these
fifteen
years
the
power
of
the
duke
sank
lower
and
lower
,
and
the
chi
was
menaced
by
his
minister
yang
huo.
in
times
so
dark
,
men
that
loved
quiet
sought
in
the
world
of
thought
an
escape
from
the
gloom
around
them
,
whilst
others
that
were
less
resigned
turned
over
in
their
minds
the
causes
of
the
realm
's
decay.
lao-tzu
,
the
founder
of
the
mystic
taoist
philosophy
,
taught
that
in
inaction
alone
peace
can
be
found
;
mo-tzu
proclaimed
the
doctrine
of
universal
love
:
that
we
should
love
all
men
as
we
love
self
,
love
the
parents
of
others
as
we
love
our
own
parents.
upright
men
were
driven
or
fled
from
the
world.
confucius
often
met
them
in
his
wanderings
,
and
was
reproved
for
not
doing
as
they
did.
but
his
practical
mind
told
him
that
inaction
could
not
help
the
world
,
and
that
to
find
a
remedy
for
the
nation
's
ills
,
their
cause
must
first
be
learned.
this
could
only
be
done
by
historical
study.
he
therefore
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
past
times
,
edited
in
later
life
the
_book
of
history_
,
and
compiled
the
work
called
_spring
and
autumn_
,
a
history
of
his
native
state
from
##number##
to
##number##
b.c.
to
bring
again
the
golden
days
of
yao
and
shun
a
return
must
be
made
to
the
principles
of
wen
and
wu
,
the
kings
that
had
rebuilt
the
empire
after
tyranny
and
selfishness
had
laid
it
low.
of
impracticable
ideals
and
renunciation
of
the
world
no
good
could
come.
at
last
in
##number##
b.c.
yang
huo
was
forced
to
flee
from
lu
,
and
prospects
brightened.
a
year
later
confucius
was
appointed
governor
of
a
town.
so
great
was
his
success
as
governor
that
before
long
he
was
promoted
to
be
superintendent
of
works
,
and
then
to
be
chief
criminal
judge.
he
won
great
influence
with
his
master
,
and
did
much
to
lighten
the
general
misery.
he
so
strengthened
the
power
of
the
duke
that
neighbouring
states
grew
jealous.
to
sow
dissension
between
duke
and
minister
the
men
of
ch
'i
sent
the
duke
a
gift
of
singing
girls.
such
joy
they
gave
him
that
for
three
days
no
court
was
held.
on
this
confucius
left
the
land
,
##number##
b.c.
for
the
next
thirteen
years
confucius
wandered
from
land
to
land
,
followed
by
his
disciples
,
seeking
in
vain
for
a
ruler
that
was
willing
to
employ
him
,
and
whom
he
was
willing
to
serve.
at
times
he
was
exposed
to
danger
,
at
other
times
to
want.
but
as
a
rule
he
was
treated
with
consideration
,
although
his
teachings
were
ignored.
yet
thirteen
years
of
homeless
wandering
,
of
hopes
deferred
and
frustrated
,
must
have
been
hard
to
bear.
when
he
left
office
confucius
was
already
fifty-three
years
old
,
and
his
life
so
far
seemed
a
failure.
the
sense
of
his
wasted
powers
may
well
have
tempted
him
now
and
again
to
take
office
under
an
unworthy
ruler
;
but
knowing
that
no
good
could
come
of
it
he
refrained
,
and
probably
he
never
seriously
thought
of
doing
so.
in
##number##
b.c.
,
when
confucius
was
sixty-six
years
old
,
through
the
influence
of
his
disciple
jan
yu
,
who
was
in
the
service
of
the
chi
,
the
master
was
invited
to
return
to
his
native
land.
here
he
remained
till
his
death
in
##number##
b.c.
he
had
many
interviews
with
the
reigning
duke
and
the
head
of
the
chi
clan
,
but
gained
no
influence
over
either
of
them.
so
he
turned
once
more
to
his
favourite
studies
;
edited
the
_book
of
poetry_
--
perhaps
the
most
interesting
collection
of
ancient
songs
extant
--
and
wrote
_spring
and
autumn_.
his
closing
years
were
darkened
by
the
loss
of
those
dearest
to
him.
first
his
son
died
,
then
yen
yuean
,
the
disciple
whom
he
loved
best.
at
his
death
the
master
was
overcome
by
grief
,
and
he
left
none
behind
him
that
loved
learning.
lastly
tzu-lu
,
the
frank
and
bold
,
was
killed
in
battle.
a
little
later
,
in
his
seventy-first
year
,
confucius
himself
passed
away

this
book
of
the
master
's
sayings
is
believed
by
the
chinese
to
have
been
written
by
the
disciples
of
confucius.
but
there
is
nothing
to
prove
this
,
and
some
passages
in
the
book
point
the
other
way.

b.c.

the
chief
authority
for
the
text
as
it
stands
to-day
is
a
manuscript
found
in
the
house
of
confucius
in

b.c.
,
hidden
there
,
in
all
likelihood
,
between
the
years

and

b.c.
,
when
the
reigning
emperor
was
seeking
to
destroy
every
copy
of
the
classics.
we
find
no
earlier
reference
to
the
book
under

but
mencius
(

quotes
seven
passages
from
it
,
in
language
all
but
identical
with
the
present
text
,
as
the
words
of
confucius.
no
man
ever
talked
the
language
of
these
sayings.
such
pith
and
smoothness
is
only
reached
by
a
long
process
of
rounding
and
polishing.
we
shall
probably
come
no
nearer
to
the
truth
than
legge
's
conclusion
that
the
book
was
put
together
by
the
pupils
of
the
disciples
of

'his

his

not
listen
to

sound.
he
served
none

his

he
ruled
none
but
his
own
people.
he
came
in
when
there
was
order
,
and
withdrew
when
tumults
came.
where
lawless
rule
showed
,
or
lawless

stayed
,
he
could
not
bear
to
dwell.
to
be
together
with
country
folk
he
thought
like
sitting
in
court
dress
and
court
cap
on
dust
and
ashes.
in
chou

time
he
dwelt
by
the
north

shore
,
waiting
for
all
below

to
grow
clean.
